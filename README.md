# musinsa_crawling_by_selenium

This is a code that uses the Selenium library to crawl information, images, and reviews of the top 90 products based on daily sales across 47 mid-level categories on the Musinsa site and saves it to a CSV file. Please note that while it works well, it takes a very long time to execute.
